##Project Description##

Airports play a vital role in the global transportation ecosystem, connecting people, cultures, and economies across the world. As air travel continues to grow, airports are facing increased pressure to ensure safety, security, and operational efficiency in their day-to-day functions. With the rapid technological advancements, the complexity of airport operations is also increasing. It is critical for the aviation industry to adapt and embrace the innovative solutions that address these challenges.
Airports depend on the efficient coordination of various departments and personnel for the safety and operational purposes. Among these essential groups, human maintenance operators play a critical role in ensuring that airport infrastructure, equipment, and systems are in optimal condition. Maintenance staff are responsible for performing routine checks, repairing, and maintaining crucial systems. They ensure that the airport functions without any interruption. However, despite their significant contributions, maintenance workers are often overlooked in airport security measures, which can lead to vulnerabilities in airport safety and operational efficiency. Ensuring the well-being and fitness of maintenance staff is crucial, as fatigue, intoxication, or other physical impairments can compromise their ability to perform tasks effectively and safely. This can result in increased risks of accidents, equipment malfunctions, and potential disruptions in airport operations.
This project focuses on the development and implementation of a novel AI-based surveillance system that detects and tracks human poses to classify the fitness levels of maintenance operators, with the goal of integrating this model with SAAB’s inbuilt SAFE (Situational Awareness for Enhanced Security) subsystem. The integration of these advanced technologies will enable airport authorities to proactively identify potential risks associated with unfit, unhealthy, drunk, or violent maintenance operators, ensuring a secure and efficient aviation environment. By monitoring the physical well-being and performance of maintenance workers, airport authorities can proactively address potential safety risks, that could compromise the effectiveness of maintenance tasks and overall airport operations.
By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, including pose estimation algorithms and advanced computer vision techniques, this system will accurately and non-invasely monitor the physical activities and movements of maintenance operators. Once integrated with SAAB’s SAFE subsystem, the combined solution will provide real-time insights into the performance and well-being of maintenance operators.
The report also discusses the potential benefits and challenges of this integration, and how it can contribute to enhanced airport security and operational efficiency. By focusing on the often-overlooked maintenance workforce, this project aims to foster a more comprehensive and effective approach to airport safety, benefiting passengers, staff, and stakeholders alike.
